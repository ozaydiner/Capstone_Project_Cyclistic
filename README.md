# Capstone_Project_Cyclistic
This is my Google capstone project which is heavily influenced by Divvy Case Study.

Could not upload the whole dataset because of the size constraints.

So basically the project is about gathering user data and defining them in 2 categories which are Casual Riders who are non-continuous users and Annual Members who are dedicated and subscription buying users. The goal is to define parameters to draw insight on the question : "How do we increase our Annual Members to increase company revenue ? "
